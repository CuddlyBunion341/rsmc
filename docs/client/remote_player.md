## Resources
- **ChunkManager**: Manages chunks of terrain data for the game world.
- **SpawnAreaLoaded**: Indicates whether the spawn area has been loaded.

## Systems
- **Player Management**:
  - `spawn_remote_player_system`: Handles the spawning of remote players based on received events.
  - `despawn_remote_player_system`: Manages the removal of players from the world when they disconnect.
  - `update_remote_player_system`: Synchronizes player states across clients.
  - `draw_gizmos`: Draws visual representations of remote players for debugging purposes.

## Context
- Includes files from the project's plugin directory located at [src/client/remote_player](https://github.com/CuddlyBunion341/hello-bevy/blob/main/src/client/remote_player).
- Incorporates [`prelude.rs`](https://github.com/CuddlyBunion341/hello-bevy/blob/main/src/client/prelude.rs) for essential imports and networking systems specific to remote player management.
